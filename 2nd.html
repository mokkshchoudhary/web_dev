    <p>The team's coach,<i> <b>Ajit Chaudhary</b> </i>, lauded his performance and was particularly impressed with his temperament on the field.[1][22] He commenced the 2005â€“06 season with a score of 227 against Punjab. Following their victory over Uttar Pradesh in the quarter-finals, Delhi was scheduled to play against Baroda in the semi-finals. The team had high expectations from Kohli, who had promised his coach to finish the job. True to his word, Kohli went on to score 228 runs, leading Delhi to victory. The team later secured the tournament with a five-wicket win over Mumbai, where he contributed with a half-century in the first innings.[1] He ended as the highest run-scorer with a total of 757 runs from 7 matches, averaging 84.11</p>
